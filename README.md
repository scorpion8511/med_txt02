This repository hosts the **BiomedCLIP Data Pipeline**, which automatically downloads and processes a set of articles from the PubMed Central Open Access dataset. The end result is a JSONL file containing figures and associated captions, which can be used to train the **BiomedCLIP** model.

For a hands-on demonstration, refer to the [example notebook](run_pmc15_pipeline.ipynb).


## Environment Setup 

```bash
# it is recmmended to use a virtual environment but not required
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Filtering Captions by Keyword

`generate_pmc15_pipeline_outputs` can restrict the dataset to figures whose
captions mention specific terms. By default it keeps only captions containing
these domain keywords and labels each figure with the matched domain(s):

- **pathology:** "pathology", "whole slide image", "H&E"
- **x-ray:** "x-ray"
- **endoscopy:** "endoscopy", "gastrology"
- **ultra:** "ultrasound"
- **mri:** "MRI"

Each figure written to `pubmed_parsed_data.json` includes a `domains` array, and
the enclosing article lists all domains found across its figures.

```python
from pmc15_pipeline.data import generate_pmc15_pipeline_outputs

generate_pmc15_pipeline_outputs()  # Use defaults shown above

# Or provide your own list of keywords
# generate_pmc15_pipeline_outputs(keywords=["custom term"])
```

## Counting Articles by Domain

After generating `pubmed_parsed_data.json`, you can see how many articles
mention each domain in their figure captions:

```python
from pmc15_pipeline.data import count_articles_with_keywords

count_articles_with_keywords()
```

Provide your own list of terms with the `keywords` argument if you want to
search for different phrases instead of the preset domains.
